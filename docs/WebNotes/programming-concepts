You're absolutely right! Blockquotes and code blocks in Markdown can sometimes be tricky to combine cleanly. I've restructured the format to ensure clean, distinct separation between the concept description and the example code, prioritizing readability.
Here is the revised format:
Fundamental Programming Concepts: The Core Toolkit 🛠️
1. Variables and Data Types
These concepts handle how information is stored and categorized within a program.
 * Variables 🧩: These are named containers that store values. Their contents can change as the program runs.
   Example: Assigning values to variables.
   age = 25              # Variable 'age' holds an integer
user_name = "Charlie" # Variable 'user_name' holds a string

 * Data Types 🔢: Classifications that tell the computer what kind of data a variable holds (e.g., number, text, or true/false). Type Casting is converting a value from one type to another.
   Example: Different basic data types and type casting.
   # Basic Types
integer_val = 10      # int
float_val = 3.14      # float
is_logged_in = True   # bool

# Type Casting
new_int = int("500")  # Converts string "500" to integer 500

2. Control Flow
Control flow structures dictate the order in which code instructions are executed, enabling decisions and repetition.
 * Conditionals ⚖️: Statements (if, elif, else) that allow your program to make decisions. A block of code runs only if a specified condition evaluates to True.
   Example: The if/else structure.
   score = 88
if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Good Job.")
else:
    print("Keep practicing.")

 * Loops 🔁: Structures used to repeatedly execute a block of code. A For Loop repeats for a set number of items, while a While Loop repeats as long as a condition is met.
   Example: Repeating an action using loops.
   # For Loop: Iterating over a range
for i in range(3):
    print(i) # Output: 0, 1, 2

# While Loop: Repeating while a condition is True
x = 0
while x < 2:
    x += 1

3. Reusability and Organization
These concepts allow developers to segment code into manageable, reusable chunks.
 * Functions ⚙️: Independent, named blocks of code designed to perform one specific task. They often take inputs (arguments) and can return an output.
   Example: Defining and calling a function.
   def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width

result = calculate_area(10, 5) # result is 50

 * Methods 🧰: Functions that are attached directly to an object or a data type (like a string, list, or custom class) and perform an action relevant to that object.
   Example: Using a built-in string method.
   phrase = "hello world"
capitalized = phrase.capitalize() # Returns "Hello world"

4. Data Structures
These are efficient formats for organizing and storing collections of related data.
 * Strings 📚: An ordered sequence of characters used to represent text. You can access individual characters by their position (index).
   Example: Accessing and manipulating strings.
   email = "test@example.com"
domain = email.split('@')[1] # Returns "example.com"

 * Lists/Arrays 🧱: An ordered, indexed collection of items. In Python, a List is dynamic and mutable. An Array is often used in other languages for a fixed-size collection of the same type.
   Example: Creating and modifying a list.
   tasks = ["buy milk", "clean", "code"]
tasks.append("sleep")   # Adds an item
print(tasks[0])         # Output: "buy milk"

 * Dictionaries/Maps 🗂️: Collections of data stored as key-value pairs. They are used for fast lookups using the unique, descriptive key instead of a numerical index.
   Example: Defining and accessing a dictionary.
   student = {
    "id": 101,
    "major": "CS",
    "gpa": 3.8
}
print(student["major"]) # Output: "CS"

5. Object-Oriented Concepts
 * Classes and Objects 📦: The basis of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). A Class is a blueprint for creating things. An Object is a specific instance (a concrete item) created from that blueprint.
   Example: Defining a simple class and creating an object.
   class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

dog = Pet("Buddy")      # 'dog' is an object of the Pet class
print(dog.name)         # Output: "Buddy"
